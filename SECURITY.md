## Reporting a Vulnerability

- You can report an issue here: https://freesewing.eu/support
- Or you can email joost, the FreeSewing maintainer, at joost@joost.at.

I do not have money to spend on a bug bounty program, but if you provide your snail mail (physical) address, I will send you some stickers.
