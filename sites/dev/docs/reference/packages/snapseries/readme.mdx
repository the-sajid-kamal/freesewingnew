## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @freesewing/snapseries
```

## Notes

All exports are plain objects with `metric` and `imperial` properties
that can be used as the `snap` property for snapped percentage options.
All measurements are in mm.

Some exports have `metric` and `imperial` properties that are
arrays of numbers.
These exports and their properties are:

- `elastics`: Arrays of common elastic widths
- `zippers`: Arrays of common zipper lengths

Other exports have `metric` and `imperial` properties that are
numbers to allow options to be _snapped_ to multiples of the value.
These exports and properties are:

- `smallSteps`: Intervals of 1 mm or 1/32 inch
- `steps`: Intervals of 5 mm or 1/8 inch
- `bigSteps`: Intervals of 10 mm or 1/2 inch
