<DocusaurusDoc>

The **Markdown** component family provides the following components:

- [Markdown](#markdown): A re-export of [react-markdown][rm]

:::tip
#### Not FreeSewing code
This component family only contains re-exports of code by other maintainers.\
Since they are a dependency, we provide them as part of the <code>@freesewing/react</code> package for convenience.

Please refer to the documentation for [react-markdown][rm].
