The **DiffViewer** component family provides the following components:

In addition, it also exports the following functions:

- [diffJSON](#diffjson): A re-export of the [diffJson][jsd] function of the [jsdiff package][jsd]

#### Not FreeSewing code
This component family only contains re-exports of code by other maintainers.\
Since they are a dependency, we provide them as part of the <code>@freesewing/react</code> package for convenience.

Please refer to the documentation for [react-diff-viewer-continued][dv] and [jsdiff][jsd].
