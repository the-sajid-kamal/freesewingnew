The **useDesign** hook provides access to the entire FreeSewing collection of designs.

<Popout type="tip" title="Beware of bundle size">
Use this hook to load a design when you plan to use the entire collection. If
you only plan to use one or a few designs, you may want to load them differently as
including this hook will include all FreeSewing designs in your code bundle.
</Popout>

## Example

<Tabs tabs="hook, named export, direct import">
<Tab>
Using the hook makes it easy to load a design if you want to be able to
dynamically load a different design, or do not know in advance what designs
should be made available.

```js
import { useDesign } from '@freesewing/react/hooks/useDesign'

const MyComponent = ({ name = 'aaron' }) => {
  const Aaron = useDesign(name)

  // ...
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
This hook has a `designs` named export that holds the entire FreeSewing collection.

```js
import { designs } from '@freesewing/react/hooks/useDesign'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const Aaron = designs.aaron

  // ...
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
If you know in advance what design you want, importing it directly is more efficient.
```js
import { Aaron } from '@freesewing/aaron'

const MyComponent = () => {

  // ...
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Return value

Calling the hook returns a design constructor, assuming the design name you pass it is in the FreeSewing collection.

## Named exports

You can also load the `collection` and `designs` named exports from the same import:

```js
import {
  collection, // Object.keys(designs)
  designs, // An object where the key is the (lowercase) design name, and the value the design constructor
  useDesign, // The hook
} from '@freesewing/react/hooks/useDesign'
```

- `collection` is an array of lowercase design names.
- `designs` is an object where the key is the (lowercase) design name, and the value the design constructor.
