The **useControl** hook provides access to the control setting of a FreeSewing user.
Use this hook whether you have a UI element that should be hidden or shown
based on the control setting.

<Popout type="tip" title="useControl vs useAccount">
  The **useControl** hook guarantees that a control value will always be available, even if no user
  is authenticated. As such, it is recommended to use this rather than the
  [useAccount](/reference/packages/react/hooks/useaccount/) hook when all you need is a control
  value, and no access to the user account.
</Popout>

## Example

```js
import { useControl } from '@freesewing/react/hooks/useControl'

const MyComponent = () => {
  control,
  setControl,
} = useControl()

  // ...
}
```

## Return value

Calling the hook returns an object with the following properties which are all methods:

- [control](#control)
- [setControl](#setControl)

### control

The control value.

### setControl

A method to set the new control value.

```js
function setControl (
  Number control // The new control value to set
)
```
