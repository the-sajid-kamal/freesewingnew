The **useFilter** hook uses [atomWithHash](https://jotai.org/docs/extensions/location#atomwithhash) under the hood.
It allows one to keep state in the URL, using the hash value.

It is named `useFilter` because it was initially created to filter FreeSewing
designs on the design page. But you can keep any sort of state with it.

## Example

```js
import { useFilter } from '@freesewing/react/hooks/useFilter'

const MyComponent = ({ name = 'aaron' }) => {
  const [filter, setFilter] = useFilter()

  // ...
}
```

## Return value

This hook behaves just as the native `useState` hook, expect that it stores the state in the URL.
