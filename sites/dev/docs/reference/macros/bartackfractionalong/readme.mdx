title: bartackFractionAlong
---

The `bartackFractionAlong` macro allows you to add a _bartack_ marker to your
sewing pattern. More specifically, a bartack along a fraction of a path.

It is provided by [plugin-annotations](/reference/plugins/annotations), which is
part of [core-plugins](/reference/plugins/core) (so it is available by default).

## Signature

```js
macro('bartackFractionAlong', {
  String id="bartack",
  Number angle=0,
  Number density=3,
  Number end=1,
  Number length=15,
  Path path,
  Number start=0,
  Number width=3,
  Boolean force = false,
})
```

## Example

<Example caption="Example of the bartackFractionAlong macro">
```js
({ Point, Path, macro, part }) => {

  macro('bartackFractionAlong', {
    path: new Path()
      .move(new Point(15,15))
      .curve(
        new Point(20, 20),
        new Point(30, 20),
        new Point(35, 15),
      ),
    start: 0.2,
    end: 0.8,
  })

  return part
}
```
</Example>

## Configuration

| Property     | Default    | Type       | Description |
|-------------:|------------|------------|-------------|
| `angle`      | `0`        | `number`   | The angle under which to draw the bartack |
| `density`    | `3`        | `number`   | Controls how close the stitches are together |
| `end`        | `1`        | `number`   | At which fraction of the path length (from `0` to `1`) should the bartack end |
| `id`         | `bartackfractionalong` | `string`  | The ID of this macro instance |
| `length`     | `15`       | `number`   | Length of the bartack |
| `path`       |            | `Path`     | The path the bartack should follow |
| `start`      | `0`        | `number`   | At which fraction of the path length (from `0` to `1`) should the bartack start |
| `width`      | `3`        | `number`   | Width of the bartack |
| `force`      | `false`    | `boolean`  | Set this to `true` to display the macro output even when `complete` is `false` |

## Notes

This macro takes the `complete` setting into account and won't output anything when both complete and `force` are `false`.
