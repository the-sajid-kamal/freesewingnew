title: Setting up the FreeSewing development environment
sidebar_position: 20
---

FreeSewing provides the studio, a development environment that visualizes your design for
you. This tutorial is for the stand-alone studio, not the
repository studio (which you may have set up if you followed a
getting started tutorial).

To set it up, I will open a terminal and enter the following command:

```sh
npx @freesewing/studio
```

After you enter the folder name to create, it will take a while to set
everything up. When it's done, you will have a new folder with the development
environment inside.

:::note

This will take a few minutes because the development environment has a number
of dependencies that need to be downloaded.

:::

You will have a new folder that contains the stand-alone studio development environment.
(Within this new folder, the `design` subfolder holds your design's configuration files and source code.
You can ignore all other subfolders and files; they are part of the development environment.)

### Creating a new design

If you would like to create a new design, enter the folder that was just
created and run the following command:

```bash
npm run add
```

After you've answered [some questions](#questions), it create a new
sub-folder for your design in the `designs` folder.

:::note

### Starting the development environment

To start the development environment, enter the folder containing the
stand-alone studio and run `npm run start`.

```bash
npm run start
```

Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

:::tip
The development environment will watch for any changes you make to
the pattern's source code or configuration.
When you do, the pattern will update automatically in your browser.
