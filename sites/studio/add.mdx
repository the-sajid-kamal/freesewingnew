title: Add a new design
---

To add a new design to the FreeSewing monorepo, run the following command
in the root folder of the monorepo:

```
npm run add
```

**TL;DR: Just follow the prompts**

This command will prompt you for a choice between adding a new plugin or a new design.
Choose **Add a new FreeSewing Design**.

Next, it will ask you for a design name, and whether you
want to create a design from scratch, or start from a block.
