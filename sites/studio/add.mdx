title: Add a new design
---

To add a new design to the FreeSewing monorepo, run the following command
in the root folder of the monorepo:

```
npm run add
```

Choose new design when it asks whether you want to add a new design or
new plugin.
It will prompt you for your design name, and ask whether you want to create a
design from scratch, or start from a block.
