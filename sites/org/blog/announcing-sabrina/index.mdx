We have just released FreeSewing v4.1, and by now you may be aware that a minor version bump typically means we have a new design.
And that's exactly what's going on here, the _Sabrina_ sports bra pattern is brand new.

## Sabrina Sports Bra

As Sabrina was designed & developed by Jonathan, so I'll let him talk about it:

> This update introduces Sabrina, a simple pull-on sports bra.
>
> I designed Sabrina as a sports bra pattern. It provides light to medium support, but please note that the fit and compression depend heavily on the fabric used. The default ease is on the low/comfortable side. If you need or prefer more compression, consider increasing the stretch to 20% or more and using a fabric with a higher compression rating.
>
> Sabrina is technically unisex. I made some prototypes using my own (male) body measurements and I like wearing them when I go running. They reduce chafing and chest bounce and provide comfortable compression.
>
> Sabrina was developed from Breanna-based prototypes, but the actual construction is independent and straightforward. Essentially, it's a rectangle with holes for the arms and head, plus a few darts to shape it to your body and reduce excess fabric. You can view the construction by enabling the 'Base' part in the Core settings under 'Only Include Selected Pattern Parts'.
>
> If you have previously made patterns with curved seams and stretchy fabric such as Shin or Bruce, you should find this bra straightforward to make.
>
> I hope you find this pattern helpful.

## Other changes

For a full list of changes, you can (as always) check the
[CHANGELOG](https://codeberg.org/freesewing/freesewing/src/branch/develop/CHANGELOG.md),
but here are some highlights:

- Fixed a broken link in the welcome flow (oops!)
- We've added support for the ARCH D and ARCH E paper sizes
- We now support preview of the absolute value of snapped percentage options
- Fixed some translations issues in _Octoplushy_
- A whole bunch of improvements and fixes in [the editor](/editor)

However, as we run our website on the very latest changes, these have been
introduced over the last couple of weeks, rather than since today.
