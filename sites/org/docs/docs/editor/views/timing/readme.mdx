title: Time Design (timing view)
---

#### Purpose of the timing view

The _timing_ view is a version of the [draft view](#draft) with extra features
for pattern designers that allows them to _time_ the impact of the various
design options and measurements on the the design.

This is an advanced feature that is of little value to regular users of the
site and intended for designers and developers.

#### Layout of the timing view

This view shares the same layout as the [draft view](#draft). However, it has
an extra area that sits below the [ribbon area](#areas) that generates a
timeseries graph of the subsequent draft operations (marked in yellow).
