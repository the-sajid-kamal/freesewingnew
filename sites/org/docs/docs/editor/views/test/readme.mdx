title: Test Design (test view)
---

#### Purpose of the test view

The _test_ view is a version of the [draft view](#draft) with extra features
for pattern designers that allows them to _test_ the impact of the various
design options and measurements on their design.

This is an advanced feature that is of little value to regular users of the
site and intended for designers and developers.

#### Layout of the test view

This view shares the same layout as the [draft view](#draft).
