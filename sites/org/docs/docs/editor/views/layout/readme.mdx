#### Purpose of the layout view

The _layout_ view allows you to customize the way the individual patterns parts
are laid out on the page(s).

:::tip
Placing pattern parts on page to use as little paper as possible -- aka
[the bin packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) -- is
one of those challenges where humans are (still) much better at than computers.

Every time you tweak your pattern, FreeSewing needs to re-draft it, calculate
the new layout, and render it on screen. For this reason, we wrote a packing
algorithm that prioritizes speed.<br />
As a result, it is often trivial for a human to come up with a more optimized layout.
This view lets you accomplish this without requiring any additional software.

If you want more control over your pattern, you can also [export it as SVG](#export)
and use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to edit it locally.
