#### Ways to provide measurements

This view has different ways that you can provide measurements:

- **Choose one of your own measurements set**<br />
  Use this to select one of the measurements sets stored in your own FreeSewing account.
- **Choose one of the measurements sets you have bookmarked**<br />
  Choose this to use a measurement set you have bookmarked, which can be either
  one of your own, or a public measurements set from another FreeSewing user.
- **Choose one of Freesewing's curated measurments sets**<br />
  Choose one of the measurements sets from the list we curate.
- **Load a measurements set by ID**<br />
  If you know the ID of the measurements set you want to use, you can load it this way.
  If it's not one of your own measurements sets, it needs to be a public set for this to work.
- **Edit measurements by hand**<br />
  Regardless of what option you choose, this allows you to edit all measurments by hand.
