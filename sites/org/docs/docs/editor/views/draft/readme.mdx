The Pattern Editors **draft view** is where you will end up spending most of
your time.

#### Purpose of the draft view

To appreciate the significance of the draft view, itâ€™s good to know what makes
a FreeSewing pattern:

<PatternDiagram />

The diagram above helps us understand the Editor's priorities:

- First it will prompt you for the design you want to use (using [the **designs** view](#designs))
- Then it will ensure we have all required measurements (using [the **measurements** view](#measurements))
- Finally it will ask you how _exactly_ you would like your pattern (using [the **draft** view](#draft))

In other words, the goal of the draft view is to let your customize your pattern.
To make that intuitive, it will show you a live preview of what your patterns looks like.

#### Caveats of the draft view

The [pattern area](#areas) implements its own pan, scroll, and zoom logic that
allows you to scroll, pan, and zoom the SVG pattern.

When this area takes up most of the screen, this can cause confusion when you
try to scroll the page, but in reality you are scrolling the pattern.

You can use the [**zoom** and **rotate** icons](#zoom-menu) anchored at the
top-right to zoom if you find that work better for you.
