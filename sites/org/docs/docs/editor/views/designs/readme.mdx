#### Purpose of the designs view

The _designs_ view allows you to chose the design you want to generate a pattern from.
It is the first thing the Editor will present you with.

#### Layout of the designs view

This view does not have a [ribbon area](#areas). The entire editor real-estate
is used for letting you choose a design.

#### Controlling the design grid

By default, you will get a grid of pictures showcasing the available designs,
as well as a list of design names at the top for quick access in case you
already know which design you want.

You can control the way the designs are displayed with the buttons between the
list of names and the grid of pictures:

| Button | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| <button className="tw:flex tw:flex-row tw:gap-2 tw:daisy-btn tw:daisy-btn-secondary tw:daisy-btn-outline"><CisFemaleIcon /> Show Line Drawings</button> | Display a line drawing for each design<br /><small>This button won't be shown when pictures are currently displayed</small> |
| <button className="tw:flex tw:flex-row tw:gap-2 tw:daisy-btn tw:daisy-btn-secondary tw:daisy-btn-outline"><ShowcaseIcon /> Show Examples</button> | Display a picture for each design<br /><small>This button won't be shown when line drawings are currently displayed</small> |
| <button className="tw:flex tw:flex-row tw:gap-2 tw:daisy-btn tw:daisy-btn-secondary tw:daisy-btn-outline"><FilterIcon /> Show Filters</button> | Display filters for the list of designs<br /><small>See [Design filters](#filters)</small> |

##### Design filters {#filters}

When you click the **Show Filters** button, it will bring up these filters:

They allow you to filter on:

- **Tags**: These designate different departments
- **Techniques**: These let you filter based on the techniques that you are comfortable with
- **Difficulty**: These let you filter based on the difficulty level of making the design

You can click on any of them to select/deselect, and can also combine filters.
