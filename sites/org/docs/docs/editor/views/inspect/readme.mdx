title: Pattern inspector (inspect view)
---

#### Purpose of the inspect view

The _inspect_ view is a version of the [draft view](#draft) with extra features
for pattern designers that allows them to _inspect_ the various points and
paths that make up a pattern.

This is an advanced feature that is of little value to regular users of the
site and intended for designers and developers.

#### Layout of the inspect view

This view shares the same layout as the [draft view](#draft).
