title: Flags Menu
---

The **Flags Menu** holds messages that were _flagged_ by the designer.

In other words, this menu facilitates communication between the original
designer and you, the person using their design.

Sometimes a flag is merely informative, sometimes they indicate there's a
potential problem with your pattern.

:::tip
The UI preferences menu is accessible in the [ribbon area](#areas) in the
[draft view](#draft) and other views that show the pattern.

:::warning
Before printing a pattern, let alone cutting into any fabric, make sure to
check all of the messages in this menu.
