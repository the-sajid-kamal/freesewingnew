The editor's **Core Settings** menu allows you to tweak various aspects of the
FreeSewing Core library, which -- under the hood -- generates your pattern for
you.

In contrast to Design options which are
specific for a given design, these **Core Settings are the same for every design**.

So you will find this menu always provides the same settings, regardless of
what design you are generating a pattern for.

:::tip
The core settings menu is accessible in the [ribbon area](#areas) in the
[draft view](#draft) and other views that show the pattern.
