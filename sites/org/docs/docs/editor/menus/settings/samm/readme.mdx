title: Seam Allowance Size
---

This Core Setting controls the base size of your seam
allowance. In other words, the default seam allowance will be this size. Other
allowance that is intended to be wider, like hem allowance, will be a multiple
of this size.

:::note
FreeSewing's core library only takes a single setting to handle seam allowance:
`sa`. However, for convenience, we've split this up into two different
settings on the website:

- **[Include Seam Allowance](#sabool)**:
  Controls whether or not to include seam allowance
- **[Seam Allowance Size](#samm)**:
  Controls how big to make the seam allowance, if it is included

The latter will only be shown if you've enabled the former.
