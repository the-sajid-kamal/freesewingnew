title: Design Options Menu
---

Each FreeSewing design can define a list of options that allow you to further
customize your pattern. You can find them in the **Design Options** menu.

Since each design has its own options, the contents of the menu will be
different for each design, but you typically find options to adjust the fit --
such as changing the amount of ease -- as well options to change the style of
the pattern.

:::tip
The design options menu is accessible in the [ribbon area](#areas) in the
[draft view](#draft) and other views that show the pattern.
