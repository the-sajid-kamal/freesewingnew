## What You Need {#needs}

To make Sarah, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable main fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))
- An invisible or regular closed end zipper
- Some sort of closure for the waist (if using a zipper)
- (Optional) About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of suitable lining fabric (see [Fabric
  Options](#fabric))

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

### Main Fabric

A pencil skirt is a rather formal cut, and most commonly is made in a suiting
material. In other words, a **fine wool**. More casual options among **medium
weight** fabrics include **cotton** or **denim**.

Using a fabric with some stretch will make it easier to get a comfortable fit
and give you some more room to move about as pencil skirts fit rather tight.
**Scuba** is often seen in pencil skirts as it is firm, has body but also
stretches.

A knit fabric may be used. Adjust the waistline down with a negative value for Extra Waist Ease so the finished garment stays up. A tighter fit along the length of the skirt may be achieved by a negative value for Extra Seat Ease.

### Lining Fabric

The lining fabric needs to be light, and allow the body to slide over it
easily. You also don't want something to thick as this will be constricting.
**Silky** fabrics are the go to choice as they are lightweight and slippery.

Stretchy main fabrics will most likely not require a lining.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

:::note
The number of front and back parts depend on if the zipper was moved to the
zipper from the side seam. Pattern options account for this. This cut list does not.
:::

**Main Fabric**

- Cut one **front** part on fold.
- Cut one **back** part on fold.

**Lining Fabric (Optional)**

- Cut one **front** part on fold.
- Cut one **back** part on fold.

:::tip
[See Sarah Instructions](/docs/designs/sarah/instructions/#lining) to
understand alterations to the front and back parts required for the lining.
:::

**Interfacing**

:::tip
When you cut out a piece on the fold, remember that the fold does not need to
be in the middle of the fabric. Choosing the placement of your pieces wisely
can greatly reduce the amount of fabric you need for your skirt.
