Sarah is the natural waist skirt block from W. Aldrich's 'Metric Pattern Cutting for Women's Wear, 6th Edition'. Blocks
like this are used as the basic shape of garment designs. This can be sewn as is for a pencil skirt. Though, there are
more options available in Penelope. This is the first pattern I drafted for myself in different software as part of a
collective attempt to learn CAD pattern drafting at my local maker space. (it's the first in the book... probably not a
coincidence). Several of the dimensions being magic and the curves being "what ever looks good" frustrated me intensely
because they wouldn't scale and the software does not contain a constraint solver to make up for that.
