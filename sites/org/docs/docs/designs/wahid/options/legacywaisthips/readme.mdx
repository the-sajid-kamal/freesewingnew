title: 'Legacy waist and hips calculations'
---

This option allows you to use the legacy way of calculating the waist
and hips.

The legacy (v3) way used the chest circumference to set the initial waist
and hips points.
It then used waist and hips measurements to attempt to move the waist
and hips points towards the actual measurement values.

The new, v4 way instead uses the actual waist and hips measurements to
set the waist and hips points.
It also contains corrections to the front waist dart and side seam
adjustments to maintain the correct width and ease at the waist and hips.
It also adjusts the armhole point after the dart rotation to maintain
the correct width and ease at the armhole.

If you enable this option, Wahid will revert to the v3 way of calculating
waist and hips points.
