## What You Need {#needs}

To make Lunetius, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 2 meters (2.2 yards) of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric options](/docs/designs/lunetius/#fabric))
- (a _fibula_ (brooch, pin, clasp) to wear and close it)

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

In the Roman era both linen and wool were widely available so both would be
appropriate for this project. Silk was also available but it was very much a
‘fancy’ fabric used to show off wealth and status as it had to come from
abroad.

A lot of the fabrics found in military contexts like excavated forts are
tightly woven twills that would be good at keeping the weather out. If you want
to have a historically appropriate fabric then a wool twill would be a great
choice.

Otherwise, any wool or linen in both plain and other weaves would be a good
choice. The fabric weight depends on your local climate and what you intend to
use the cloak for. However if you want to hand sew the Lunetius it can help to
choose a slightly lighter weight fabric to make sewing easier on your hands.

If you are not working with any historicalness in mind Lunetius can be made out
of a variety of fabrics. A woven fabric would drape in a different way compared
to a stretch or knitted fabric but you are only limited by your imagination.

## Cutting Instructions {#cutting}

- Cut **1 lacerna** part on the fold
- or Cut **2 lacerna** parts

The way to cut Lunetius is going to depend on what fabric you have chosen to
use. If you have enough fabric width you can cut it _on the fold_. If you
don’t, you can cut two halves and later sew them together. To not have to later
finish the centre back edge you can cut with the centre back edge on the
selvage.

A lot of garments were woven to shape in the Roman era, so this is one aspect
where you don’t need to worry about historical accuracy at all, unless you
would like to weave your Lunetius to shape.

  Tunic and Toga of the Arringatore_ in Textile History 13 (1), pp 3-25

### On Historical Accuracy

The further we go back in time, the less extant garments we have to base
research on. Often there may be scraps of fabric left behind by stroke of luck
but most of our information starts to come from (in archaeology) secondary
sources like written texts from contemporaries.

This is especially true for the Roman and Mediaeval eras, not to mention that a
lot of the available research is behind a paywall.

We can’t be 100 percent historically accurate, because we’re living in a
different time, and everything we use to sew is different now from before. Even
fabric is woven in a different way.

How ‘accurate’ you want to be is up to you, there is no wrong way to do this
and research is not required -- though it can be fun!
