This controls how the seam allowance is drawn.

The standard value is to omit seam allowance from the arm scyes and neck opening and should be used if you're using knit binding or fold over elastic for the openings.

You can also enable drawing the seam allowance on all edges, which is helpful if you're constructing the garment using the burrito Method.
