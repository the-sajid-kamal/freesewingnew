I designed Sabrina as a sports bra pattern. It provides light to medium support, but please note that the fit and compression depend heavily on the fabric used. The default ease is on the low/comfortable side. If you need or prefer more compression, consider increasing the stretch to more than 20% and using a fabric with a higher compression rating.

Sabrina is technically unisex. I made some prototypes using my own (male) body measurements and I like wearing them when I go running. They reduce chafing and chest bounce and provide comfortable compression.

You may also be able to use Sabrina as a chest binder if you use a stiffer fabric and the right ease settings, but please be careful and don't hurt yourself with too much compression.

Sabrina was developed from Breanna-based prototypes, but the actual construction is independent and straightforward. Essentially, it’s a rectangle with holes for the arms and head, plus a few darts to shape it to your body and reduce excess fabric. You can view the construction by enabling the ‘Base’ part in the Core settings under ‘Only Include Selected Pattern Parts’.

If you have previously made patterns with curved seams and stretchy fabric such as Shin or Bruce, you should find this bra straightforward to make.

I hope you find this pattern helpful.
