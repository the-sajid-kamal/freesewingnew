title: Where can I download the sewing patterns?
---

It can be frustrating for visitors who come here expecting a website where they
can download sewing patterns that they can't seem to find the sewing patterns
to download. Almost like hiding the _download button_ is some elaborate scheme
to waste their time.

In reality, FreeSewing is _very_ different from a website with some
links to PDF sewing patterns.

You can [generate bespoke patterns here](/) but if you are looking for a list
of patterns to download, [you have not understood what it is that we do here](/docs/about/).
