title: Using the FreeSewing.eu website
---

On these pages, we'll paint a high-level picture of how to get the most out of
the FreeSewing.eu website.

If you are in a hurry, skip ahead to [How to
generate bespoke sewing patterns](/docs/about/site/draft/).

## Finding your way

On every page of FreeSewing.eu is the same header with links to the most
important sections of the site:

- [Designs](/designs/) shows our collection of parametric
  designs you can generate bespoke sewing patterns from.
- [Docs](/docs/) is short for _documentation_ and that's exactly what it provides.
- [Showcase](/showcase/) show examples from the
  FreeSewing community, things they have made with FreeSewing patterns
- [Blog](/blog/) holds blog posts with updates and news
  about FreeSewing
- [Forum](https://forum.freesewing.eu/) is a link to
  [forum.freesewing.eu](htps://forum.freesewing.eu/), our user forum.
- [Account](/account/) is where you can manage your
  FreeSewing account. (if you are logged in, your username will be shown instead).
- [Support](https://freesewing.eu/support/) lists your options for where to
  get help
- [Search](https://freesewing.eu/search/) can help you find something if
  you're not certain where to start looking

In addition, the header also has buttons to change the **Theme** (or color
scheme) and **Language** of the website.

On mobile, the header is at the bottom of the page and because of space
constraints not all of these links are shown. However, click the _hamburger
icon_ to open the menu that contains all of these links.

## Signing up or Signing in

You can sign up for a FreeSewing account at
[/signin](https://freesewing.eu/signin/). We support signing in with your
Google or GitHub account if that is easier for you.

If you already have an account, you can sign in to your account at at
[/signin](https://freesewing.eu/signin/).

Some functionality requires a FreeSewing account. So I will assume you have an
account for the remainder of these instructions.

## Important account settings

When your signed in, you can navigate to
[/account](https://freesewing.eu/account/) to manage the data stored in your
account, which includes various settings.

I'd like to highlight a couple of them that are worth your attention:

### User Experience

The [User Experience setting](https://freesewing.eu/account/control/) allows
you to gradually reveal more complexity. If you are a little overwhelmed with
everything FreeSewing.eu has to offer, setting this to a lower value will
gradually hide more features for the sake of simplicity. But setting a higher
value here will show more features and functionality.

Dial this setting down if you want a simpler experience. Turn it up if you want
more power, or some things that you know exists are not shown on your screen.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Please enable [Two-Factor Authentication](https://freesewing.eu/account/mfa/)
to secure your FreeSewing account.
